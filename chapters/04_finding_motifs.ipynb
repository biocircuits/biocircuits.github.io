    "### Historical context\n",
    "In the early 2000s, automation and high-throughput assays began to transform biology. Previously, molecular biologists had generally analyzed systems in terms of (at most) a handful of genes and their corresponding functions. However, DNA microarrays and other new technolopgies allowed them to read out expression of thousands of genes in parallel.  moving assays to the genome scale. Researchers began to ask how every gene responded to a given perturbation, which genes were co-regulated by a particular transcription factor, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The promise of so much data was tantalyzing. Could one use these rich new data sets to \"see,\" for the first time, the  complete circuit diagram of a cell? Could one mathematically model the global circuitry of cells? And, if so, could that ability to be used to better understand, predict, and, ultimately, control cellular behavior? \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was that obtaining large data sets and extracting meaningful insights from them were, and are, two very different things. For instance, suppose you were given a data set providing the regulatory interactions among all the transcription factors within an organism. What would you analyze it? What could you learn from it? \n",
    "\n",
    "The breakthrough discovery of **circuit motifs** provided one crucial answer, demonstrating directly how one could obtain powerful new functional insights into genetic circuits from high throguhput data. Today we are going to define circuit motifs and see how they can be systematically discovered from maps of regulatory interactions. In the next chapter, we will focus on the functions of the most prevalent motifs. Our treatment follows the one in _Alon._"

    "## _Sequence motifs_ identify cis-regulatory sites\n",
    "\n",
    "The motif principle is quite general. Before it was applied to network motifs, it was used to identify functional motifs in genome sequences. For example, [Bussemaker et al, _PNAS_, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.180265397) presented an algorithm called _MobyDick_ that identifies \"words\" (letter sequence motifs), in any \"text\" (sequence of letters). They tested it out on the text of the classic novel Moby Dick, with spaces and punctuation removed, recovering a dictionary of English words that appear in the novel. Then, they used it on the yeast genome sequence to identify cis-regulatory sites, including binding sites\n"

    "### A circuit can be represented as a directed graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A regulatory circuit can be thought of abstractly as a **directed graph**--a set of nodes connected by arrows. For the transcriptional circuitry of a bacterium, each node represents an operon (a set of genes co-transcribed from a single promoter and independently translated to produce a corresponding set of proteins), and each arrow could represent regulation of one operon (tip of the arrow) by a transcription factor in another operon (base of the arrow).\n",
    "\n",
    "A **circuit motif** (originally called a ‘network motif’) is defined as an over-represented regulatory pattern--or **sub-graph** within the overall circuit or graph. Note that to qualify as a 'motif', and not just an interesting pattern, it should occur significantly more frequently than one would expect under some reasonable null hypothesis. The enrichment of the motif within the larger circuitry indicates that it has been selected by evolution, repeatedly. This selection suggests that the motif could play an important role as a functional module within the larger circuit. Other features of the circuit that are not motifs can also play important roles. But, because of their prevalence, motifs provide a natural focal point for circuit analysis.\n",

    "To make the comparison as fair as possible, we need to design variant graphs that maintain the key statistical properties of the original graph. Specifically, we insist that all variant graphs have the same number of nodes and arrows. But this is not really enough: It wouldn't make sense to compare this graph, whose arrows are distributed over all the nodes to a variant in which, say, all arrows stem from a single source node, or converge on a single target node. Therefore, we also need to impose a stronger constraint: maintaining the exact distribution of incoming and outgoing arrows for each node. \n",

    "If you examine the graphs above, you can see that they were constructed to have the same numbered nodes. Furthermore, the number of arrows exiting and entering each numbered node is exactly the same in all graphs. For example, node 4 always has 2 outgoing arrows. Node 6 always has one incoming and two outgoing arrows, node 12 always has 2 incoming arrows, and so on. \n",

Then one would tie each \"+\" end to a randomly chosen \"-\" end. Voila, a new randomized graph is guaranteed, through this procedure, to maintain the same joint distribution of incoming and outgoing arrows. For more details, see the algorithms in [Shen-Orr et al, _Nat. Genet._, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng881) and in [M. E. J. Newman et al, _Phys. Rev.

An example of a matrix representation of a graph is shown below. Here, an arrow from node $i$ to node $j$ is represented by $M_{i,j}=1$. The absence of such an arrow would be represented by $M_{i,j}=0$.

    "## How do sub-graph abundances scale?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some species have much larger genomes than others. How would you expect the number of instances of different sub-graphs to change with the size of the overall circuit? You might at first think that larger circuits would simply have more copies of all possible sub-graphs. However, this is not the case. To see why, let's try to get a better intuition for how often we expect to see various sub-graphs appear in graphs of different sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will ask: What is the probability of obtaining an n-vertex sub-graph, $G$, by chance in a large random graph with $N$ nodes and $E$ edges? Clearly the answer will depend on the number of nodes, $n$, and edges, $g$, in $G$. For the FFL, $n=3, g=3$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many biological networks are **sparse**, meaning the probability, $p$, of any potential edge occurring is low. Since the number of possible edges is $N^2$, so that $p = E/N^2 \\ll 1$. For _E. coli_, $p≈0.002$. We will therefore focus on this regime. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question then becomes, for large sparse graphs, how should the expected number of occurrences of sub-graph, $G$, scale with the size of the circuit, or number of nodes, $N$?. For this argument, we will ignore numerical prefactors, and focus only on the dependence on $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Within the overall network the number of potential instances of $G$ is the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in $G$, e.g. $n=3$ for the FFL. \n",
    "2. The probability that any one of these potential instances is the desired sub-graph, is proportional to $p^g$, where $g$ denotes the number of edges in the $G$, e.g. $g=3$ for the FFL. There is also a permutation factor, representing the number of different ways that you could make the desired sub-graph from a set of 3 nodes. We neglect this factor because it is independent of $N$. \n",

    "This is $N^n$ times numerical factors that are independent of $N$.\n",
