    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past several chapters, we have encountered the concept of robustness through several examples. Through our study of dosage compensation, we saw how expression level of a gene can be robust to variations in the copy number of that gene via an incoherent feed-forward loop. Through our examination of chemotaxis, we saw how circuit architecture can endow a bacterial cell with exact adaptation robustly with respect to enzyme levels over many orders of magnitude. Finally, in our study of signal amplification, we saw how bifunctionality of enzymes can achieve perfect linear amplification completely independently of (and therefore robust to) variations in the total level of signaling molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final chapter on robustness, we will discuss the process of **kinetic proofreading**, the process by which cells achieve the remarkable fidelity of their core transcriptional and translational processes. Here we will focus on translation, though there are interesting proofreading mechanisms at play in transcription as well. The robustness statement is: *The fidelity of translation is robust to inherent thermal fluctuations.* This is a different flavor of robustness; kinetic proofreading is a mechanism by which the function of a biochemical process, in this case translation, achieves a higher fidelity that what is naively expected by equilibrium processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error rate in translation of mRNA to protein by ribosomes is about $10^{-4}$ errors per amino acid. We will work out whether or not this error rate is high or low compared to equilibrium expections, and then discuss mechanisms about how it is achieved. The design principle we will explore is more general: **Driven multistep pathways enable amplification of selectivity.** By the word \"driven,\" we mean that energy consuming reactions are necessary for the multiple steps."

The stacking interactions are not as important here, since the bases are confined within the geometry of the ribosome.

This is accomplished by a kinetic proofreading mechanism that uses a simple idea. Imagine an MHC candidate binds a T cell receptor. Before the immune response can proceed, a sequence of phosphorylations of the receptor must occur. The phosophorylations can only occur when the receptor is bound. While waiting for these phosphorylation events endogenous MHCs, which have a faster rate of dissociation from the receptor, may fall off, while the agonist MHCs have a better chance of hanging on before the signal to the immune response can be transmitted.
