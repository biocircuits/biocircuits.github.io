The stacking interactions are not as important here, since the bases are confined within the geometry of the ribosome.

This is better even than electronic circuits. This is accomplished by a kinetic proofreading mechanism that uses a simple idea. Imagine an MHC candidate binds a T cell receptor. Before the immune response can proceed, a sequence of phosphorylations of the receptor must occur. The phosophorylations can only occur when the receptor is bound. While waiting for these phosphorylation events endogenous MHCs, which have a faster rate of dissociation from the receptor, may fall off, while the agonist MHCs have a better chance of hanging on before the signal to the immune response can be transmitted.
