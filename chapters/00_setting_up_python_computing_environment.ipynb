    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "As will become readily apparent even at the beginning of our journey into biological circuit design, you will need to use your computer to analyze circuits and understand the principles governing their function. There are plenty of approaches we could take, and many languages we could use for computing as well. Indeed, in addition to Python, [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)/[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), [R](https://www.r-project.org), [Julia](http://julialang.org/), [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), and others are widely used. We have chosen to use Python. Though we view this as an unessential choice (we believe language wars are counterproductive and welcome anyone to port the code we use to any language of their choice), we nonetheless feel we should explain our choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a flexible programming language that is widely used in many applications. This is in contrast to more domain-specific languages like R and Julia. It is easily extendable, which is in many ways responsible for its breadth of use. We find that there is a decent Python-based tool for many applications we can dream up, certainly in systems biology. However, the Python-based tool is seldom the _very best_ for the particular task at hand, but it is almost always _pretty good_. Thus, knowing Python is like having a Swiss Army knife; you can wield it to effectively accomplish myriad tasks. Finally, we also find that it has a shallow learning curve with most students.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if we had to choose another language, it would be Julia. Julia is a well-designed, modern language for scientific computing. Its tools for numerical differential equations, an important method we employ, are superb."

    "## Why not use systems biology packages?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are packages available to streamline systems biology calculations, such as [PySB](http://pysb.org) or [Matlab's SymBiology](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simbiology.html). While these packages are useful, we find that many applications in systems biology, and in genetic circuits in particular, need, or at least benefit from, bespoke computational analyses. We therefore will build all of our code from scratch, using only packages like [NumPy](http://numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://scipy.org/), and [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/), which contain core numerical and plotting data structures and routines. Of course, code we use in one chapter may be reused in another, but our approach is that we build all of the code we need as we go along. This will provide a greater level of mastery and less reliance on black boxes (though there will inevitably be some)."

As of March 2023, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari are supported. Microsoft Edge is not. Therefore, if you are a Windows user, you need to be sure you have either Chrome of Firefox installed. Because we encourage users to run code on their own machine (and because nearly every computer has a browser application), we expect most of our readers to use JupyterLab. We give instructions below on how to do the necessary installations and launch JupyterLab.\n",
    "- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com): This is an excellent source code editor that supports Jupyter notebooks. Be sure to read [the documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) on how to use Jupyter notebooks in VSCode.\n",
    "- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): Google offers this service to run notebooks in the cloud on their machines. As of March 2023, users can run on two core machines for free. There are a few caveats, though. First, not all packages and updates are available in Colab. Furthermore, not all interactivity that will work natively in Jupyter notebooks works with Colab. Finally, if a notebook sits idle for too long, you will be disconnected from Colab. All of the notebooks in the HTML rendering of this book have an \"Open in Colab\" button at the upper right that allows you to launch the notebook in Colab. This is a quick-and-easy way to execute the book's contents."
