Suddenly, a cell needs to start producing the protein, so the gene is turned on at time $t = 0$.  Starting from initial conditions of $m(0) = p(0) = 0$, solve the ODEs (numerically or otherwise) for both the unregulated and autoregulated systems. You should choose parameters as would be typical for a bacterial cell. The excellent [BioNumbers website](http://bionumbers.org/) will be helpful.
