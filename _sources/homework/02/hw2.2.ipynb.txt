We found that when we considered the concentration of effectors as \"inputs\" and the resulting concentration of Z as an \"output\" we could think of the regulatory architecture as a logic gate.\n", "\n", "\n", "**a)** We used a formalism to where we wrote down the states of the promoter region (unbound, bound with X, bound with Y, bound with both X and Y) and the respective weights of each state. We then came up with a regulatory function by summing the weights for which the promoter may bind and dividing by the sum of the weights. Now, we'll work backwards. Write down an expression for a dimensionless regulatory function $f(x,y)$ that would correspond to an XOR gate. The truth table for an XOR gate is below.\n", "\n", "X | Y | Z\n", ":---:|:---:|:----------:\n", "0 | 0 | 0\n", "0 | 1 | 1\n", "1 | 0 | 1\n", "1 | 1 | 0\n", "\n", "Based on this expression what would have to be true of the promoter architecture in terms of how the effectors may bind?

That is, X and Y are inputs and the output is the concentration of a single gene product Z. You will likely need to have more than just X, Y, and Z in your circuit. Clearly explain the thinking behind the circuit you chose. Are there feedforward loops in your circuit? How about feedback loops?\n", "\n", "**c)** Demonstrate that your proposed circuit works by modeling its dynamics with a system of ODEs.
