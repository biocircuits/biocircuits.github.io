In their [2012 paper](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1218351), the researchers in Galit Lahav's group investigated how temporal dynamics of p53 controls cell fate in [MCF-7 cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7), a breast cancer cell line. It had been previously observed that p53 levels oscillate upon exposure to stress due to \u03b3 radiation. To instead study how cells respond to sustained levels of p53, the authors controlled p53 levels using the drug Nutlin-3. To do this, they devised a program for adjusting Nutlin-3 levels in the cell culture that would keep the p53 levels at a constant high level. They based this program on a mathematical model of the p53 circuit (shown in the figure below) that they developed and parametrized in an [earlier paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2008.03.016).\n", "\n", "<div style=\"margin: auto; width: 300px\">\n", "    \n", "![p53 circuit](p53_circuit.svg)\n", "\n", "</div>\n", "\n", "The p53 levels oscillate due to a delays in the autoinhibitory loops mediated by Mdm2 and Wip1.
