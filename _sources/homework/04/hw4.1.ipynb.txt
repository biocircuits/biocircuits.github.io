Oxygen is delivered to the cells of your body through your blood. Naturally, cells are situated at difference distances from blood vessels. As oxygen diffuses away from the blood vessels, different cells experience different local oxygen concentrations, often very different concentrations. How, then, do cells respire at the same rate, despite the large difference in oxygen concentration?\n", "\n", "This is a question of robustness. Is rate of respiration robust to differences in oxygen concentration over a physiologically relevant operating regime? To address this question consider a simple model of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) consisting of a single electron carrier C and two reactions that catalyze its oxidation and reduction, shown in below.\n", "\n", "<div style=\"margin: auto; width: 200px;\">\n", "\n", "![co-substrate competition schematic](kueh_oxygen.svg)\n", "    \n", "</div>\n", "    \n", "The carrier can exist in an oxidized state C\u2080 and in a reduced state C\u2081.

We will do so by first splitting the system into its two enzyme-catalyzed reactions. We start with the lower one.

This is the quantity we are most interested in; it is the rate of oxygen consumption. We can describe this reaction as follows. The substrate C\u2081 cannot bind oxygen unless complexed with the enzyme E\u2080, to which is binds reversibly. The C\u2081\u00b7E\u2080 complex can them reversibly bind oxygen. Finally, the C\u2081\u00b7E\u2080\u00b7O\u2082 complex gets irreversibly converted to oxidized substrate C\u2080, freeing the enzyme E\u2080 and producing water in the process.

Physiol., 1965](https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.49.1.163) says that $K_m$ scales linearly with the maximal rate of electron transfer (the maximal $v_1$), and inversely with the reaction rate constant for oxygen reduction ($k_0$).
