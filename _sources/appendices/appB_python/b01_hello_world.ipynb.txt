This stands in contrast to **compiled languages**. For these languages (the dominant ones being Fortran, C, and C++), your entire code is translated into machine language before you ever run it. When you execute your program, it is already in machine language.\n",

Rather, we will have a *greatly* enhanced Python experience using Jupyter notebooks. Nevertheless, as you go beyond notebooks and do more sophisticated computing in your adventures with biological circuits, it is good to know about running Python outside of notebooks, so we will do that now."

However, you can run over 40 different languages in a JupyterLab, not just Julia, Python, and R.\n",

So, a Jupyter notebook is not good for an application where you are building reusable code or scripts. However, Jupyter notebooks are **very** useful in the following applications.\n",

    "1. *Exploring data/analysis.* Jupyter notebooks are great for trying things out with code, or exploring a data set. This is an important part of the research process. The layout of Jupyter notebooks is great for organizing thoughts as you synthesize them.\n",
    "2. *Sharing your thinking in your analysis.* Because you can combine nicely formatted text and executable code, Jupyter notebooks are great for sharing how you go about doing your calculations with collaborators and with readers of your publications. Famously, LIGO used [a Jupyter notebook](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html) to explain the signal processing involved in their first discovery of a gravitational wave.\n",

If you did not explicitly execute a cell early in the document, its results are not known to the Python interpreter. **This is a very important point and is often a source of confusion and frustration for students.**\n",
