We did not discuss how such a control mechanism might be implemented in the positive autoregulation circuit we analyzed in this chapter. Consider some possible molecular implementations of such a \"control knob\" that could be built into the positive autoregulation circuit to allow a user to toggle the circuit between its high and low fixed points."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<br />"]}], "metadata": {"anaconda-cloud": {}, "kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3 (ipykernel)", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.9.7"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
