We will assume a separation of time scales in mRNA and protein degradation/dilution such that we only need to consider the dynamics of the protein, and we will call its concentration $x$.  We will further assume that the autoactivation effect can be modeled as a Hill function with Hill coefficient $n$.\n", "\n", "<div style=\"width: 225px; margin: auto\">\n", "\n", "![autoactivator](autoactivator.png)\n", "\n", "</div>\n", "\n", "**a)** Write down an ODE describing the dynamics of $x$.

(This is the same model for an autoactivating circuit we used in the chapter, but now including leakage.)\n", "\n", "**b)** Show that in the absence of ultrasensitivity ($0 < n \\le 1$), only one steady state exists for $\\alpha > 0$. Show further that when $\\alpha = 0$, two steady states may exist, but only one is stable and the stable one has $x > 0$.\n", "\n", "**c)** In part (b), we considered the case where activation is not ultrasensitive. We now consider the other extreme, where activation is infinitely ultrasensitive. Derive the condition for bistability when $n\\to\\infty$.  In other words, for what parameter values does the circuit exhibit two stable steady states? Discuss this condition as it relates to design principles for bistability."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<br />"]}], "metadata": {"anaconda-cloud": {}, "kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3 (ipykernel)", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.9.7"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
