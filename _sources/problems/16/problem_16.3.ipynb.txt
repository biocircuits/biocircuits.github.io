With these parameters set, the value of $r_0$ is set such that the long-time average total number of proteins, $n_t = m + n$, is (approximately) 20. We do this so that we can make clear comparisons between parameter sets; we want them all to have the same average expression level and we can then explore bursty dynamics and noise.
