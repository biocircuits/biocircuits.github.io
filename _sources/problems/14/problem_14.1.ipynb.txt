Such a binary differentiation may be regulated by a genetic circuit akin to the toggle circuits we have already encountered. However, the progenitor state of the CMP cells is also stable, which suggests tristability of the underlying circuit. In particular, the transcription factors GATA1 (which we will call X for convenience) and PU.1 (which we will call Y) are mutually repressive, which gives them the toggle-like behavior. They also are autoactivating. These interactions are summarized in the circuit below.\n", "\n", "<div style=\"margin: auto; width: 200px\">\n", "\n", "![tristable toggle](tristable_toggle.png)\n", "    \n", "</div>\n", "\n", "\n", "[Huang and coworkers (_Dev. Biol._, 2007)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.02.036) claimed that this circuit can give tristability. Your task is to assess that claim. Model the circuit where the repression of X by Y and X's autoactivation exhibits OR logic as does repression of Y by X and Y's autoactivation.
