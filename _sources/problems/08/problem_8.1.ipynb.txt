In this problem, we will consider a model for kinetic proofreading in the immune system. T cells recognize specific agonist major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) on an antigen presenting cell (APC). The APCs also have many endogenous MHCs that should not trigger T cell activation. It has been proposed that T cells are able to distinguish agonist MHCs (which should trigger T cell activation) and endogenous MHCs (which should not trigger T cell activation) via a kinetic proofreading mechanism. Such a mechanism is shown in below. In the figure, M = MHC and T = T cell receptor (TCR). The complexes $\\mathrm{C}_i$ denote MHC-TCR complexes with various stages of phosphorylation. In this model, all complexes may dissociate and \"reset\" to an unbound MHC and TCR. The rate of activation of T cells is proportional to the concentration of complex $\\mathrm{C}_n$. We say that $\\mathrm{C}_n$ is the \"active form.\"\n", "\n", "<div style=\"margin: auto; width:600px;\">\n", "\n", "![kinetic proofreading TCR](kinetic_proofreading_TCR.png)\n", "    \n", "</div> \n", "\n", "In this problem, we will ask you to think carefully about what plots and what limits are useful for analyzing the system and making conclusions about it.

Consider only a single MHC species, M. To make notation consistent, let $c_i$ be the concentration of $\\mathrm{C}_i$, $c_T$ be the concentration of T-cell receptors, and $c_M$ be the concentration of unbound MHCs.\n", "\n", "**b)** Until part (g), assume that $k_{-n} = k_{-1}$.
