Starting from a set of nodes and directed edges (arrows), we enforce that each node has the same number of incoming and outgoing arrows. It is a fun (and challenging!) problem to implement such an algorithm, which is what you will do in this problem.\n", "\n", "We showed that the directed graph can be pictorially represented as a set of nodes with arrows, or as an asymmetric matrix of ones and zeros. Alternatively, and more compactly, it may be represented as an array of 2-tuples, with each 2-tuple representing an arrow connecting two numbered nodes. As an example `(8, 2)` represents an arrow going from node 8 to node 2, and `(10, 11)` represents an arrow going from node 10 to node 11.\n", "\n", "**a)** Write a function that takes as input an array of 2-tuples representing the regulatory connections of numbered genes and returns an array of 2-tuples representing a random directed graph in which each node (gene) has the same number of incoming and outgoing arrows as in that input network.\n", "\n", "**b)** Write another function that takes as input an array of 2-tuples representing a network and an array of 2-tuples representing a specific regulatory architecture and then returns the number of instances of that architecture in the input network. Here are some example architectures.\n", "\n", "- Simple regulation: `[(1, 2)]`\n", "- Mutual regulation (as in a toggle circuit): `[(1, 2), (2, 1)]`.\n", "- FFL: `[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]`\n", "\n", "**c)** Play with your functions with sample circuits.
