    "We worked out that for unregulated gene expression, the steady state level of gene product is $\\beta/\\gamma$, where $\\beta$ is the production rate and $\\gamma$ is the degradation rate. A steady state may be achieved for low $\\beta$ and low $\\gamma$, for high $\\beta$ and high $\\gamma$, and everything in between, provided the ratio $\\beta/\\gamma$ is the same.\n",

    "A **loss function**, also known as a **cost function**, takes as input an operating parameter or set of parameters and returns the \"cost\" associated operating with the given parameter value(s). Sketch a loss function $L(\\beta)$ as a function of $\\beta$, assuming $\\beta/\\gamma$ is held constant. Describe why the curve might have the shape it does. Note that there is no right answer, or even a quantitative one, for this problem. It is meant to get you thinking about what some of the costs may be that are associated with different operating regimes."
