    "*This problem derived from discussions with H. Y. Kueh, and is based on his paper* ([Biophys J., _**104**, 1338–1348, 2013_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2013.01.030)).\n",

    "To put this problem in context, let us think about an intriguing question. Oxygen is delivered to the cells of your body through your blood. Naturally, cells are situated at difference distances from blood vessels. As oxygen diffuses away from the blood vessels, different cells experience different local oxygen concentrations, often very different concentrations. How, then, do cells respire at the same rate, despite the large difference in oxygen concentration?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a question of robustness. Is rate of respiration robust to differences in oxygen concentration over a physiologically relevant operating regime? To address this question consider a simple model of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) consisting of a single electron carrier C and two reactions that catalyze its oxidation and reduction, shown in below.\n",

    "**a)** In this part of the problem and in part (b), we will write down governing ODEs for the dynamics of this system. We will do so by first splitting the system into its two enzyme-catalyzed reactions. We start with the lower one. We can write the reaction as \n",

The substrate C₁ cannot bind oxygen unless complexed with the enzyme E₀, to which is binds reversibly. The C₁·E₀ complex can them reversibly bind oxygen. Finally, the C₁·E₀·O₂ complex gets irreversibly converted to oxidized substrate C₀, freeing the enzyme E₀ and producing water in the process. We can write these steps as follows.\n",

    "**e)** You have shown that for some operating regime, the rate of oxygen consumption is robust to variation of oxygen concentration. Now imagine that the system is in steady state and there is a sudden step in oxygen concentration. In looking at your differential equation in part (b), you should be able to identify the time scale for recovery to steady state consumption rate. Is the time to recovery robust to variations in oxygen concentration? If so, over what operating regime?\n",
    "\n",
    "**f)** Define the oxygen concentration for which the steady state oxygen consumption rate is half-maximal as $K_\\mathrm{m}$. The Chance relationship [Chance, J. Gen. Physiol., 1965](https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.49.1.163) says that $K_\\mathrm{m}$ scales linearly with the maximal rate of electron transfer (the maximal $v_1$), and inversely with the reaction rate constant for oxygen reduction ($k_0$). In the regime where oxygen consumption rate is independent of oxygen concentration, does this system satisfy the Chance relation?"
