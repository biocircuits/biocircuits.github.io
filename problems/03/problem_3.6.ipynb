    "In the circuits we have analyzed so far, we have neglected the extra effort a cell must exert to express genes within the circuit. Some gene products may be more expensive to make and maintain than others. If a cell is expending resources to make a gene product that does not contribute to growth (or if the gene product is toxic), growth will be slowed as more of the gene product is made. \n",

    "[Tan and coworkers](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fnchembio.218) explored the possibility of bistability if the autoactivation is *not* ultrasensitive by considering the case where the dilution/degradation rate $\\gamma$ is not constant, slowing as more gene product, in this case the activator, is made. In practice, Tan, et al., used a mutant T7 RNA polymerase as the autoactivator, but in theory, any autoactivator that reduces growth rate will suffice.\n",
