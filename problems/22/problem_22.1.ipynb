    "As discussed in lecture, Turing patterns tend to have a wavelength that is independent of the size of the system, which means that they do not scale. Werner and coworkers proposed a model for interactions of an expander (E) with the classical Turing activator (A)-inhibitor (B) components. The model is shown below.\n",

Remember, these models are postulates of what *might* be happening in developing organisms, so it is useful to dream up alternatives."
